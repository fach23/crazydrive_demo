# crazydrive_demo
This repository contains demo of the crazdrive trajectory planner. The source code might be published in the future. 

- The trajectory planner uses a nonlinear kinematic vehicle model represented in curvilinear coordinates.
- The trajectory planner is implemented in C++ and makes use of acados. More specifically the RTI scheme, the gauss newton hessian approximation and the QP Solver HPIPM with partial condensing is used.
